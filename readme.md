# cynlitadmin

 Admin

 A [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) 5.2.x, [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) 3.5.x, and [AdminLTE](https://almsaeedstudio.com/themes/AdminLTE/documentation/index.html) 2.3.x. project.

CynAdmin   is a MultiPourpos Admin-Panel that is built To be able to help cut on Back End development time and build any type of site you want and if you're a developer, to be able to create additional functionality easily.

We do this by first, using a solid "framework" of sorts. The latest and best software is used, including the Laravel PHP framework, Semantic UI CSS framework, SaSS, VueJS 2 framework and others.

This first version is early on and we have a lot of exciting things planned. So stay tuned and see at the bottom of this page for contact info, feel free to ask for help or give us feedback any time!

## Requirements

Below you will find the requirements necessary to run CynAdmin. Since the Panel is using modern technologies, the versions of software required are newer than normal. The good news is, outside of the ZIP PHP extension, all the requirements are based on [**Laravel**](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5#server-requirements).

* PHP &gt;= 7.0.0
* OpenSSL PHP Extension
* XML PHP Extension
* PDO PHP Extension
* Tokenizer PHP Extension
* Mbstring PHP Extension
* ZIP PHP Extension \(for installation of plugins/themes and upgrades inside the Admin\)
* MySQL Server
